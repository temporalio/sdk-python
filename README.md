[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine used to
execute asynchronous long-running business logic in a scalable and resilient way.

"Temporal Python SDK" is the framework for authoring workflows and activities using the Python programming language.

In addition to this documentation, see the [samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python) repository for code
examples.

**⚠️ UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

The Python SDK is under development. There are no compatibility guarantees nor proper documentation pages at this time.

Currently missing features:

* Async activity support (in client or worker)
* Support for Windows arm, macOS arm (i.e. M1), Linux arm, and Linux x64 glibc < 2.31.
* Full documentation

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the `temporalio` package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio).

These steps can be followed to use with a virtual environment and `pip`:

* [Create a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
* Update `pip` - `python -m pip install -U pip`
  * Needed because older versions of `pip` may not pick the right wheel
* Install Temporal SDK - `python -m pip install temporalio`

The SDK is now ready for use.

### Implementing a Workflow

Create the following script at `run_worker.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from temporalio import workflow, activity
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker

@activity.defn
async def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

@workflow.defn
class SayHello:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        return await workflow.execute_activity(
            say_hello, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)
        )

async def main():
    # Create client connected to server at the given address
    client = await Client.connect("http://localhost:7233")

    # Run the worker
    worker = Worker(client, task_queue="my-task-queue", workflows=[SayHello], activities=[say_hello])
    await worker.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Assuming you have a [Temporal server running on localhost](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/quick-install/), this
will run the worker:

    python run_worker.py

### Running a Workflow

Create the following script at `run_workflow.py`:

```python
import asyncio
from temporalio.client import Client

# Import the workflow from the previous code
from my_worker_package import SayHello

async def main():
    # Create client connected to server at the given address
    client = await Client.connect("http://localhost:7233")

    # Execute a workflow
    result = await client.execute_workflow(SayHello.run, "my name", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")

    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Assuming you have `run_worker.py` running from before, this will run the workflow:

    python run_workflow.py

The output will be:

    Result: Hello, my-name!

## Usage

### Client

A client can be created and used to start a workflow like so:

```python
from temporalio.client import Client

async def main():
    # Create client connected to server at the given address and namespace
    client = await Client.connect("http://localhost:7233", namespace="my-namespace")

    # Start a workflow
    handle = await client.start_workflow(MyWorkflow.run, "some arg", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")

    # Wait for result
    result = await handle.result()
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```

Some things to note about the above code:

* A `Client` does not have an explicit "close"
* A single positional argument can be passed to `start_workflow`. If there are multiple arguments, only the
  non-type-safe form of `start_workflow` can be used (i.e. the one accepting a string workflow name) and it must be in
  the `args` keyword argument.
* The `handle` represents the workflow that was started and can be used for more than just getting the result
* Since we are just getting the handle and waiting on the result, we could have called `client.execute_workflow` which
  does the same thing
* Clients can have many more options not shown here (e.g. data converters and interceptors)
* A string can be used instead of the method reference to call a workflow by name (e.g. if defined in another language)

#### Data Conversion

Data converters are used to convert raw Temporal payloads to/from actual Python types. A custom data converter of type
`temporalio.converter.DataConverter` can be set via the `data_converter` client parameter. Data converters are a
combination of payload converters and payload codecs. The former converts Python values to/from serialized bytes, and
the latter converts bytes to bytes (e.g. for compression or encryption).

The default data converter supports converting multiple types including:

* `None`
* `bytes`
* `google.protobuf.message.Message` - As JSON when encoding, but has ability to decode binary proto from other languages
* Anything that [`json.dump`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump) supports

As a special case in the default converter, [data classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) are
automatically [converted to dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.asdict) before
encoding as JSON. Since Python is a dynamic language, when decoding via
[`json.load`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load), the type is not known at runtime so, for example,
a JSON object will be a `dict`. As a special case, if the parameter type hint is a data class for a JSON payload, it is
decoded into an instance of that data class (properly recursing into child data classes).

### Workers

Workers host workflows and/or activities. Here's how to run a worker:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
# Import your own workflows and activities
from my_workflow_package import MyWorkflow, my_activity

async def run_worker(stop_event: asyncio.Event):
    # Create client connected to server at the given address
    client = await Client.connect("http://localhost:7233", namespace="my-namespace")

    # Run the worker until the event is set
    worker = Worker(client, task_queue="my-task-queue", workflows=[MyWorkflow], activities=[my_activity])
    async with worker:
        await stop_event.wait()
```

Some things to note about the above code:

* This creates/uses the same client that is used for starting workflows
* While this example accepts a stop event and uses `async with`, `run()` and `shutdown()` may be used instead
* Workers can have many more options not shown here (e.g. data converters and interceptors)

### Workflows

#### Definition

Workflows are defined as classes decorated with `@workflow.defn`. The method invoked for the workflow is decorated with
`@workflow.run`. Methods for signals and queries are decorated with `@workflow.signal` and `@workflow.query`
respectively. Here's an example of a workflow:

```python
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import timedelta
from temporalio import activity, workflow
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker

@dataclass
class GreetingInfo:
    salutation: str = "Hello"
    name: str = "<unknown>"

@workflow.defn
class GreetingWorkflow:
    def __init__() -> None:
        self._current_greeting = "<unset>"
        self._greeting_info = GreetingInfo()
        self._greeting_info_update = asyncio.Event()
        self._complete = asyncio.Event()

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:
        self._greeting_info.name = name
        while True:
            # Store greeting
            self._current_greeting = await workflow.execute_activity(
                create_greeting_activity,
                self._greeting_info,
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),
            )
            workflow.logger.debug("Greeting set to %s", self._current_greeting)
            
            # Wait for salutation update or complete signal (this can be
            # cancelled)
            await asyncio.wait(
                [self._greeting_info_update.wait(), self._complete.wait()],
                return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED,
            )
            if self._complete.is_set():
                return self._current_greeting
            self._greeting_info_update.clear()

    @workflow.signal
    async def update_salutation(self, salutation: str) -> None:
        self._greeting_info.salutation = salutation
        self._greeting_info_update.set()

    @workflow.signal
    async def complete_with_greeting(self) -> None:
        self._complete.set()

    @workflow.query
    async def current_greeting(self) -> str:
        return self._current_greeting

@activity.defn
async def create_greeting_activity(info: GreetingInfo) -> str:
    return f"{info.salutation}, {info.name}!"
```

Some things to note about the above code:

* This workflow continually updates the queryable current greeting when signalled and can complete with the greeting on
  a different signal
* Workflows are always classes and must have a single `@workflow.run` which is an `async def` function
* Workflow code must be deterministic. This means no threading, no randomness, no external calls to processes, no
  network IO, and no global state mutation. All code must run in the implicit `asyncio` event loop and be deterministic.
* `@activity.defn` is explained in a later section. For normal simple string concatenation, this would just be done in
  the workflow. The activity is for demonstration purposes only.
* `workflow.execute_activity(create_greeting_activity, ...` is actually a typed signature, and MyPy will fail if the
  `self._greeting_info` parameter is not a `GreetingInfo`

Here are the decorators that can be applied:

* `@workflow.defn` - Defines a workflow class
  * Must be defined on the class given to the worker (ignored if present on a base class)
  * Can have a `name` param to customize the workflow name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified class name
* `@workflow.run` - Defines the primary workflow run method
  * Must be defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`, not a base class (but can _also_ be defined on the same
    method of a base class)
  * Exactly one method name must have this decorator, no more or less
  * Must be defined on an `async def` method
  * The method's arguments are the workflow's arguments
  * The first parameter must be `self`, followed by positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single
    argument that is an object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.
* `@workflow.signal` - Defines a method as a signal
  * Can be defined on an `async` or non-`async` function at any hierarchy depth, but if decorated method is overridden,
    the override must also be decorated
  * The method's arguments are the signal's arguments
  * Can have a `name` param to customize the signal name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified method name
  * Can have `dynamic=True` which means all otherwise unhandled signals fall through to this. If present, cannot have
    `name` argument, and method parameters must be `self`, a string signal name, and a `*args` varargs param.
  * Non-dynamic method can only have positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single argument that is an
    object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.
  * Return value is ignored
* `@workflow.query` - Defines a method as a query
  * All the same constraints as `@workflow.signal` but should return a value
  * Temporal queries should never mutate anything in the workflow

#### Running

To start a locally-defined workflow from a client, you can simply reference its method like so:

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
from my_workflow_package import GreetingWorkflow

async def create_greeting(client: Client) -> str:
    # Start the workflow
    handle = await client.start_workflow(GreetingWorkflow.run, "my name", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")
    # Change the salutation
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.update_salutation, "Aloha")
    # Tell it to complete
    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.complete_with_greeting)
    # Wait and return result
    return await handle.result()
```

Some things to note about the above code:

* This uses the `GreetingWorkflow` from the previous section
* The result of calling this function is `"Aloha, my name!"`
* `id` and `task_queue` are required for running a workflow
* `client.start_workflow` is typed, so MyPy would fail if `"my name"` were something besides a string
* `handle.signal` is typed, so MyPy would fail if `"Aloha"` were something besides a string or if we provided a
  parameter to the parameterless `complete_with_greeting`
* `handle.result` is typed to the workflow itself, so MyPy would fail if we said this `create_greeting` returned
  something besides a string

#### Invoking Activities

* Activities are started with non-async `workflow.start_activity()` which accepts either an activity function reference
  or a string name.
* A single argument to the activity is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of
  start/execute activity and must be supplied via the `args` keyword argument.
* Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the activity arguments. At least one of `start_to_close_timeout`
  or `schedule_to_close_timeout` must be provided.
* The result is an activity handle which is an `asyncio.Task` and supports basic task features
* An async `workflow.execute_activity()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as
  `workflow.start_activity()` and `await`s on the result. This should be used in most cases unless advanced task
  capabilities are needed.
* Local activities work very similarly except the functions are `workflow.start_local_activity()` and
  `workflow.execute_local_activity()`

#### Invoking Child Workflows

* Child workflows are started with async `workflow.start_child_workflow()` which accepts either a workflow run method
  reference or a string name. The arguments to the workflow are positional.
* A single argument to the child workflow is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of
  start/execute child workflow and must be supplied via the `args` keyword argument.
* Child workflow options are set as keyword arguments after the arguments. At least `id` must be provided.
* The `await` of the start does not complete until the start has been accepted by the server
* The result is a child workflow handle which is an `asyncio.Task` and supports basic task features. The handle also has
  some child info and supports signalling the child workflow
* An async `workflow.execute_child_workflow()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as
  `workflow.start_child_workflow()` and `await`s on the result. This should be used in most cases unless advanced task
  capabilities are needed.

#### Timers

* A timer is represented by normal `asyncio.sleep()`
* Timers are also implicitly started on any `asyncio` calls with timeouts (e.g. `asyncio.wait_for`)
* Timers are Temporal server timers, not local ones, so sub-second resolution rarely has value

#### Conditions

* `workflow.wait_condition` is an async function that doesn't return until a provided callback returns true
* A `timeout` can optionally be provided which will throw a `asyncio.TimeoutError` if reached (internally backed by
  `asyncio.wait_for` which uses a timer)

#### Asyncio and Cancellation

Workflows are backed by a custom [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) event loop. This means many
of the common `asyncio` calls work as normal. Some asyncio features are disabled such as:

* Thread related calls such as `to_thread()`, `run_coroutine_threadsafe()`, `loop.run_in_executor()`, etc
* Calls that alter the event loop such as `loop.close()`, `loop.stop()`, `loop.run_forever()`,
  `loop.set_task_factory()`, etc
* Calls that use a specific time such as `loop.call_at()`
* Calls that use anything external such as networking, subprocesses, disk IO, etc

Cancellation is done the same way as `asyncio`. Specifically, a task can be requested to be cancelled but does not
necessarily have to respect that cancellation immediately. This also means that `asyncio.shield()` can be used to
protect against cancellation. The following tasks, when cancelled, perform a Temporal cancellation:

* Activities - when the task executing an activity is cancelled, a cancellation request is sent to the activity
* Child workflows - when the task starting or executing a child workflow is cancelled, a cancellation request is sent to
  cancel the child workflow
* Timers - when the task executing a timer is cancelled (whether started via sleep or timeout), the timer is cancelled

When the workflow itself is requested to cancel, `Task.cancel` is called on the main workflow task. Therefore,
`asyncio.CancelledError` can be caught in order to handle the cancel gracefully.

#### Workflow Utilities

While running in a workflow, in addition to features documented elsewhere, the following items are available from the
`temporalio.workflow` package:

* `continue_as_new()` - Async function to stop the workflow immediately and continue as new
* `info()` - Returns information about the current workflow
* `logger` - A logger for use in a workflow (properly skips logging on replay)
* `now()` - Returns the "current time" from the workflow's perspective

### Activities

#### Definition

Activities are functions decorated with `@activity.defn` like so:

```python
from temporalio import activity

@activity.defn
async def say_hello_activity(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

Some things to note about activity definitions:

* The `say_hello_activity` is `async` which is the recommended activity type (see "Types of Activities" below)
* A custom name for the activity can be set with a decorator argument, e.g. `@activity.defn(name="my activity")`
* Long running activities should regularly heartbeat and handle cancellation
* Activities can only have positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single argument that is an
  object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.

#### Types of Activities

There are 3 types of activity callables accepted and described below: asynchronous, synchronous multithreaded, and
synchronous multiprocess/other. Only positional parameters are allowed in activity callables.

##### Asynchronous Activities

Asynchronous activities, i.e. functions using `async def`, are the recommended activity type. When using asynchronous
activities no special worker parameters are needed.

Cancellation for asynchronous activities is done via
[`asyncio.Task.cancel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel). This means that
`asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised (and can be caught, but it is not recommended). An activity must heartbeat to
receive cancellation and there are other ways to be notified about cancellation (see "Activity Context" and
"Heartbeating and Cancellation" later).

##### Synchronous Activities

Synchronous activities, i.e. functions that do not have `async def`, can be used with workers, but the
`activity_executor` worker parameter must be set with a `concurrent.futures.Executor` instance to use for executing the
activities.

Cancellation for synchronous activities is done in the background and the activity must choose to listen for it and
react appropriately. An activity must heartbeat to receive cancellation and there are other ways to be notified about
cancellation (see "Activity Context" and "Heartbeating and Cancellation" later).

###### Synchronous Multithreaded Activities

If `activity_executor` is set to an instance of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` then the synchronous activities
are considered multithreaded activities. Besides `activity_executor`, no other worker parameters are required for
synchronous multithreaded activities.

###### Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities

If `activity_executor` is set to an instance of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is _not_
`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, then the synchronous activities are considered multiprocess/other activities.

These require special primitives for heartbeating and cancellation. The `shared_state_manager` worker parameter must be
set to an instance of `temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager`. The most common implementation can be created by passing a
`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager` (i.e. result of `multiprocessing.managers.Manager()`) to
`temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.create_from_multiprocessing()`.

Also, all of these activity functions must be
["picklable"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled).

#### Activity Context

During activity execution, an implicit activity context is set as a
[context variable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html). The context variable itself is not visible, but
calls in the `temporalio.activity` package make use of it. Specifically:

* `in_activity()` - Whether an activity context is present
* `info()` - Returns the immutable info of the currently running activity
* `heartbeat(*details)` - Record a heartbeat
* `is_cancelled()` - Whether a cancellation has been requested on this activity
* `wait_for_cancelled()` - `async` call to wait for cancellation request
* `wait_for_cancelled_sync(timeout)` - Synchronous blocking call to wait for cancellation request
* `is_worker_shutdown()` - Whether the worker has started graceful shutdown
* `wait_for_worker_shutdown()` - `async` call to wait for start of graceful worker shutdown
* `wait_for_worker_shutdown_sync(timeout)` - Synchronous blocking call to wait for start of graceful worker shutdown
* `raise_complete_async()` - Raise an error that this activity will be completed asynchronously (i.e. after return of
  the activity function in a separate client call)

With the exception of `in_activity()`, if any of the functions are called outside of an activity context, an error
occurs. Synchronous activities cannot call any of the `async` functions.

##### Heartbeating and Cancellation

In order for an activity to be notified of cancellation requests, they must invoke `temporalio.activity.heartbeat()`.
It is strongly recommended that all but the fastest executing activities call this function regularly. "Types of
Activities" has specifics on cancellation for asynchronous and synchronous activities.

In addition to obtaining cancellation information, heartbeats also support detail data that is persisted on the server
for retrieval during activity retry. If an activity calls `temporalio.activity.heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and
is retried, `temporalio.activity.info().heartbeat_details` will return an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the
next run.

##### Worker Shutdown

An activity can react to a worker shutdown. Using `is_worker_shutdown` or one of the `wait_for_worker_shutdown`
functions an activity can react to a shutdown.

When the `graceful_shutdown_timeout` worker parameter is given a `datetime.timedelta`, on shutdown the worker will
notify activities of the graceful shutdown. Once that timeout has passed (or if wasn't set), the worker will perform
cancellation of all outstanding activities.

The `shutdown()` invocation will wait on all activities to complete, so if a long-running activity does not at least
respect cancellation, the shutdown may never complete.

## Development

The Python SDK is built to work with Python 3.7 and newer. It is built using
[SDK Core](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/) which is written in Rust.

### Local development environment

- Install the system dependencies:

  - Python >=3.7
  - [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx) (only needed for installing the two dependencies below)
  - [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) `pipx install poetry`
  - [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) `pipx install poethepoet`

- Use a local virtual env environment (helps IDEs and Windows):

  ```bash
  poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
  ```

- Install the package dependencies (requires Rust):

  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```

- Build the project (requires Rust):

  ```bash
  poe build-develop
  ```

- Run the tests (requires Go):

  ```bash
  poe test
  ```

### Style

* Mostly [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Notable exceptions:
  * We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting, so that takes precedence
  * In tests and example code, can import individual classes/functions to make it more readable. Can also do this for
    rarely in library code for some Python common items (e.g. `dataclass` or `partial`), but not allowed to do this for
    any `temporalio` packages or any classes/functions that aren't clear when unqualified.
  * We allow relative imports for private packages
  * We allow `@staticmethod`
