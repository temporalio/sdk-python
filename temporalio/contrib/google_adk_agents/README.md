# Google ADK Agents SDK Integration for Temporal

This package provides the integration layer between the Google ADK and Temporal. It allows ADK Agents to run reliably within Temporal Workflows by ensuring determinism and correctly routing external calls (network I/O) through Temporal Activities.

## Benefits of Temporal to the ADK

Temporal provides a holistic, unified solution that centralizes your orchestration needs in one Workflow abstraction. Rather than cobbling together separate servers, task queues, gateways, and databases, you get:

- **Recovering from crashes and stalls automatically**, rather than manually managing [sessions](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/session/#example-examining-session-properties) and [resuming](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/runtime/resume/#resume-a-stopped-workflow) them. (Google offers [Vertex Agent Engine](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/agent-engine/sessions/manage-sessions-adk), which still leaves resumption to the user). No need to set up a separate [database](https://dev.to/greyisheepai/mastering-google-adk-databasesessionservice-and-events-complete-guide-to-event-injection-and-pdm#understanding-adk-databasesessionservice)
    - Along with [Retries](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies) and mechanisms for handling backpressure and rate limits.
- **Support for [ambient](https://temporal.io/blog/orchestrating-ambient-agents-with-temporal)/long-running agent patterns** via blocking awaits and [worker versioning](https://docs.temporal.io/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning).
- **Automatic execution state [persistence](https://docs.temporal.io/temporal-service/persistence)**, not just for agent interactions but for any custom automations in your workflows, without setting up a separate [database](https://dev.to/greyisheepai/mastering-google-adk-databasesessionservice-and-events-complete-guide-to-event-injection-and-pdm#understanding-adk-databasesessionservice).
- For **Human-in-the-Loop patterns,** an api gateway to scalably [route](https://docs.temporal.io/task-routing) incoming messages (such as user chats) to awaken the correct workflow on your worker pool.
- [**Long-running tools](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools-custom/function-tools/#long-run-tool) support** using [Activities](https://docs.temporal.io/activities) — no need to set up and maintain microservices.
- [Manage and debug your agent workflow](https://temporal.io/resources/on-demand/demo-ai-agent) execution and pinpoint problems using Temporal UI.

## Benefits of the ADK to Temporal

ADK provides: (from the [ADK overview](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/#learn-more)):

- Improved Agent development velocity with a first-class Agentic abstraction and integration with LLMs and an ecosystem of tools.
- Improved agent robustness using built-in evals
- Build complex agents using its Multi-agent architecture.
- [Safety and security](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/safety/), via guardrails and integrations with sandboxing solutions like Vertex Agent Runtime.

## What's Included

### Core ADK Integration
- **`TemporalModel`**: Intercepts model calls and executes them as Temporal activities
- **`GoogleAdkPlugin`**: Worker plugin that configures runtime determinism and Pydantic serialization
- **`invoke_model`**: Activity for executing LLM model calls with proper error handling

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration  
- **`TemporalMcpToolSet`**: Executes MCP tools as Temporal activities
- **`TemporalMcpToolSetProvider`**: Manages toolset creation and activity registration
- Full support for tool confirmation and event actions within workflows

### OpenTelemetry Integration
- Automatic instrumentation for ADK components when exporters are provided
- Tracing integration that works within Temporal's execution context
- Support for custom span exporters

### Key Features

#### 1. Deterministic Runtime
- Replaces `time.time()` with `workflow.now()` when in workflow context
- Replaces `uuid.uuid4()` with `workflow.uuid4()` for deterministic IDs
- Automatic setup when using `GoogleAdkPlugin`

#### 2. Activity-Based Model Execution
Model calls are intercepted and executed as Temporal activities with configurable:
- Timeouts (schedule-to-close, start-to-close, heartbeat)
- Retry policies
- Task queues
- Cancellation behavior
- Priority levels

#### 3. Sandbox Compatibility
- Automatic passthrough for `google.adk`, `google.genai`, and `mcp` modules
- Works with both sandboxed and unsandboxed workflow runners

#### 4. Advanced Serialization
- Pydantic payload converter for ADK objects
- Proper handling of complex ADK data types
- Maintains type safety across workflow boundaries

## Usage

### Basic Setup

**Agent (Workflow) Side:**
```python
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import TemporalModel
from temporalio.workflow import ActivityConfig
from google.adk import Agent


# Add to agent
agent = Agent(
    name="test_agent",
    model=TemporalModel("gemini-2.5-pro", activity_config=ActivityConfig(summary="Researcher Agent")), 
)
```

**Worker Side:**

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import GoogleAdkPlugin

client = await Client.connect(
    "localhost:7233",
    plugins=[
        GoogleAdkPlugin(),
    ],
)

worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="my-queue",
)
```

### Advanced Features

**With MCP Tools:**

```python
import os
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker

from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import (
    GoogleAdkPlugin,
    TemporalMcpToolSetProvider,
    TemporalMcpToolSet,
)


def toolset_factory(_):
    return McpToolset(
        connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
            server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                command="npx",
                args=[
                    "-y",
                    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                    os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),
                ],
            ),
        ),
    )

# Use in agent workflow
agent = Agent(
    name="test_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",
    tools=[
        TemporalMcpToolSet(
            "my-tools",
            not_in_workflow_toolset=toolset_factory,
        )
    ],
)

client = await Client.connect(
    "localhost:7233",
    plugins=[
        GoogleAdkPlugin(
            toolset_providers=[
                TemporalMcpToolSetProvider("my-tools", toolset_factory),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)

# Configure worker
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="task-queue"
)
```

`TemporalMcpToolSet` also accepts an optional `factory_argument`. It is sent to the toolset activities and passed to the registered `toolset_factory` when the `McpToolset` is created.

**Do not pass secrets, credentials, or API keys through `factory_argument`.** It is an activity argument, so it is recorded in workflow history and, without a payload codec, visible in the web UI. Resolve credentials worker-side inside the toolset factory instead.

### Reading Session State in Activity Tools

ADK's live `ToolContext` holds non-serializable objects, so it cannot be an
activity argument. To read the serializable subset from an activity-backed
tool, declare a parameter named `tool_context` annotated with
`ToolContextSnapshot`:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio import activity
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents.workflow import (
    ToolContextSnapshot,
    activity_as_tool,
)


@activity.defn
async def get_weather(query: str, tool_context: ToolContextSnapshot) -> dict:
    db_url = tool_context.state.get("url", "")
    ...


weather_tool = activity_as_tool(
    get_weather, start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30)
)
```

Exactly like a native ADK function tool's `tool_context` parameter, it is
excluded from the LLM-facing tool schema; at invocation the wrapper snapshots
the live `ToolContext` (session state as a plain dict, plus the function-call
id) and passes it to the activity. Annotating any parameter with a live ADK
context type raises `ValueError` at wrap time, since ADK would inject the
non-serializable context into it regardless of its name.

When running under Temporal, the entire session state crosses the activity
boundary: every value in it must be serializable by the configured data
converter and the total size must fit within payload limits, even for keys
the tool never reads. Local ADK runs pass the snapshot in memory and have no
such constraint.

The snapshot is one-way and should be treated as read-only: mutations inside
the activity do not propagate back to the session, because the activity may
run on a different worker (and in local ADK runs, where the snapshot is
passed in memory, nested state values may alias the live session state, so
mutating them can corrupt the session). To modify session state, return the
needed information from the activity and apply it in workflow-side code (for
example an ADK callback or a plain tool function).

### Local ADK Runs

The same agent definitions can also be exercised outside Temporal with
`adk run` or `adk web`.

- `TemporalModel` and `activity_as_tool(...)` work in local ADK runs without
  additional configuration.
- If the agent uses `TemporalMcpToolSet`, define a shared toolset factory,
  register it with `TemporalMcpToolSetProvider(...)` for workflow runs, and
  reuse the same function for `not_in_workflow_toolset=...` so the agent can
  fall back to the underlying `McpToolset` when it is not running inside
  `workflow.in_workflow()`.

Example:

```python
# Reuse the same toolset_factory registered in GoogleAdkPlugin above.
agent = Agent(
    name="test_agent",
    model=TemporalModel("gemini-2.5-pro"),
    tools=[
        TemporalMcpToolSet(
            "my-tools",
            not_in_workflow_toolset=toolset_factory,
        )
    ],
)
```

## Telemetry and Workflow Replay

ADK records OpenTelemetry metrics (scope `gcp.vertex.agent`, e.g.
`gen_ai.client.token.usage`), spans, and log events (e.g. `gen_ai.choice`)
through the process-global OpenTelemetry providers from code that runs
inside the workflow. Workflow code re-executes on every replay, so with a
plain global provider each replay re-records all of that telemetry even
though no model or tool actually ran again — for example, 1 real execution
followed by 3 replays yields 4x the observations on every instrument and 4
copies of every log event. Replays happen routinely in production: workflow
cache eviction, worker restarts, redeploys, or running with
`max_cached_workflows=0`.

To avoid this, install Temporal's replay-safe providers as the global
OpenTelemetry providers. They pass recordings through on first execution and
drop them during replay:

```python
import opentelemetry._logs
import opentelemetry.metrics
import opentelemetry.trace
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs import LoggerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs.export import BatchLogRecordProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

from temporalio.contrib.opentelemetry import (
    ReplaySafeLoggerProvider,
    ReplaySafeMeterProvider,
    create_tracer_provider,
)

# The global set_*_provider functions only take effect once per process, so
# these wrappers must be the first and only global providers set.
opentelemetry.metrics.set_meter_provider(
    ReplaySafeMeterProvider(
        MeterProvider(metric_readers=[PeriodicExportingMetricReader(my_exporter)])
    )
)
tracer_provider = create_tracer_provider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(my_span_exporter))
opentelemetry.trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)
logger_provider = LoggerProvider()
logger_provider.add_log_record_processor(BatchLogRecordProcessor(my_log_exporter))
opentelemetry._logs.set_logger_provider(ReplaySafeLoggerProvider(logger_provider))
```

`GoogleAdkPlugin` warns at worker and replayer configuration time when the
global meter or tracer provider is positively identified as not replay-safe
(an OpenTelemetry SDK provider used directly). The global logger provider is
not checked because the OpenTelemetry logs SDK has no public import path yet,
but the same replay duplication applies to it.

Recordings are first-execution-only, matching
`temporalio.workflow.metric_meter()`: a retried workflow task re-executes
live and can record again, and tokens consumed by failed activity attempts
are not counted. Telemetry recorded from activities (worker-side) is
unaffected.

## Integration Points

This integration provides comprehensive support for running Google ADK Agents within Temporal workflows while maintaining:
- **Determinism**: All non-deterministic operations are routed through Temporal
- **Observability**: Full tracing and activity visibility
- **Reliability**: Proper retry handling and error propagation  
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom tools via MCP protocol
