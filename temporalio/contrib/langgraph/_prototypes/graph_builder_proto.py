"""Prototype 5: Test graph reconstruction in activities.

Technical Concern:
    Activities need to reconstruct the graph. The proposal suggests importing
    a graph builder function by module path.

Questions to Answer:
    1. Can we reliably import a function by module path?
    2. Does the reconstructed graph have equivalent nodes?
    3. Should we pass builder path as activity argument or use registry?
    4. How to handle graphs defined in __main__?

Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED - placeholder for commit 6

# Implementation will be added in commit 6
