"""Prototype 3: Inspect PregelExecutableTask structure.

Technical Concern:
    The proposal assumes specific structure of PregelExecutableTask including
    task.proc, task.writes, task.input, task.config, task.name.

Questions to Answer:
    1. What attributes does PregelExecutableTask have?
    2. Is task.proc.ainvoke() the correct invocation method?
    3. Is task.writes a deque we can extend?
    4. What does task.input contain?
    5. What is in task.config?

Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED - placeholder for commit 4
"""

# Implementation will be added in commit 4
