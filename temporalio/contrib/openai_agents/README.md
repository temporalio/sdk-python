# OpenAI Agents SDK Support

⚠️ **Experimental** - This module is not yet stable and may change in the future.

For questions, please join the [#python-sdk](https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTT84RS0P) Slack channel at [temporalio.slack.com](https://temporalio.slack.com/).

This module provides a bridge between Temporal durable execution and the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python).

## Background

If you want to build production-ready AI agents quickly, you can use this module to combine [Temporal durable execution](https://docs.temporal.io/evaluate/understanding-temporal#durable-execution) with OpenAI Agents.
Temporal's durable execution provides a crash-proof system foundation, and OpenAI Agents offers a lightweight and yet powerful framework for defining agent functionality.


## Approach

The standard control flow of a single AI agent involves:

1. Receiving *input* and handing it to an *LLM*.
2. At the direction of the LLM, calling *tools*, and returning that output back to the LLM.
3. Repeating as necessary, until the LLM produces *output*.

The diagram below illustrates an AI agent control flow.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["INPUT"] --> B["LLM"]
    B <--> C["TOOLS"]
    B --> D["OUTPUT"]
```

To provide durable execution, Temporal needs to be able to recover from failures at any step of this process.
To do this, Temporal requires separating an application's deterministic (repeatable) and non-deterministic parts:

1. Deterministic pieces, termed *workflows*, execute the same way if re-run with the same inputs.
2. Non-deterministic pieces, termed *activies*, have no limitations—they may perform I/O and any other operations.

Temporal maintains a server-side execution history of all state state passing in and out of a workflow, using it to recover when needed. 
See the [Temporal documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/evaluate/understanding-temporal#temporal-application-the-building-blocks) for more information.

How do we apply the Temporal execution model to enable durable execution for AI agents?

- The core control flow, which is managed by the OpenAI Agents SDK, goes into a Temporal workflow.
- Calls to the LLM provider, which are inherently non-deterministic, go into activities.
- Calls to tools, which could contain arbitrary code, similarly go into activities.

This module ensures that LLM calls and tool calls originating from the OpenAI Agents SDK run as Temporal activities.
It also ensures that their inputs and outputs are properly serialized.

## Basic Example

Let's start with a simple example.

The first file, `hello_world_workflow.py`, defines an OpenAI agent within a Temporal workflow.

```python
# File: hello_world_workflow.py
from temporalio import workflow

# Trusted imports bypass the Temporal sandbox, which otherwise
# prevents imports which may result in non-deterministic execution.
with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from agents import Agent, Runner

@workflow.defn
class HelloWorldAgent:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        agent = Agent(
            name="Assistant",
            instructions="You only respond in haikus.",
        )

        result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=prompt)
        return result.final_output
```

If you are familiar with Temporal and with Open AI Agents SDK, this code will look very familiar.
We annotate the `HelloWorldAgent` class with `@workflow.defn` to define a workflow, then use the `@workflow.run` annotation to define the entrypoint.
We use the `Agent` class to define a simple agent, one which always responds with haikus.
Within the workflow, we start agent using the `Runner`, as is typical, passing through `prompt` as an argument.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about this code is the `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` context manager that precedes the OpenAI Agents SDK imports.
This statement tells Temporal to skip sandboxing for these trusted libraries.
This is important because Python's dynamic nature forces Temporal's Python's sandbox to re-validate imports every time a workflow runs, which comes at a performance cost.
The OpenAI Agents SDK also contains certain code that Temporal is not able to validate automatically for determinism.

The second file, `run_worker.py`, lauches a Temporal worker.
This is a program that connects to the Temporal server and receives work to run, in this case `HelloWorldAgent` invocations.

```python
# File: run_worker.py

import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta

from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.contrib.openai_agents.invoke_model_activity import ModelActivity
from temporalio.contrib.openai_agents.open_ai_data_converter import open_ai_data_converter
from temporalio.contrib.openai_agents.temporal_openai_agents import set_open_ai_agent_temporal_overrides
from temporalio.worker import Worker

from hello_world_workflow import HelloWorldAgent

async def worker_main():
    # Configure the OpenAI Agents SDK to use Temporal activities for LLM API calls
    # and for tool calls.
    with set_open_ai_agent_temporal_overrides(
        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10)
    ):
        # Create a Temporal client connected to server at the given address
        # Use the OpenAI data converter to ensure proper serialization/deserialization
        client = await Client.connect(
            "localhost:7233",
            data_converter=open_ai_data_converter,
        )

        model_activity = ModelActivity(model_provider=None)
            worker = Worker(
                client,
                task_queue="my-task-queue",
                workflows=[HelloWorldAgent],
                activities=[model_activity.invoke_model_activity],
            )
            await worker.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(worker_main())
```

We wrap the entire `worker_main` function body in the `set_open_ai_agent_temporal_overrides()` context manager.
This causes a Temporal activity to be invoked whenever the OpenAI Agents SDK invokes an LLM or calls a tool.
We also pass the `open_ai_data_converter` to the Temporal Client, which ensures proper serialization of OpenAI Agents SDK data.
We create a `ModelActivity` which serves as a generic wrapper for LLM calls, and we register this wrapper's invocation point, `model_activity.invoke_model_activity`, with the workflow.

In order to launch the agent, use the standard Temporal workflow invocation:

```python
# File: run_hello_world_workflow.py

import asyncio

from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.common import WorkflowIDReusePolicy
from temporalio.contrib.openai_agents.open_ai_data_converter import open_ai_data_converter

from hello_world_workflow import HelloWorldAgent

async def main():
    # Create client connected to server at the given address
    client = await Client.connect(
        "localhost:7233",
        data_converter=open_ai_data_converter,
    )

    # Execute a workflow
    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        HelloWorldAgent.run,
        "Tell me about recursion in programming.",
        id="my-workflow-id",
        task_queue="my-task-queue",
        id_reuse_policy=WorkflowIDReusePolicy.TERMINATE_IF_RUNNING,
    )
    print(f"Result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This launcher script executes the Temporal workflow to start the agent.

Note that this basic example works without providing the `open_ai_data_converter` to the Temporal client that executes the workflow, but we include it because morem complex uses will generally need it.


## Using Temporal Activities as OpenAI Agents Tools

One of the powerful features of this integration is the ability to convert Temporal activities into OpenAI Agents tools using `activity_as_tool`.
This allows your agent to leverage Temporal's durable execution for tool calls.

In the example below, we apply the `@activity.defn` decorator to the `get_weather` function to create a Temporal activity.
We then pass this through the `activity_as_tool` helper function to create an OpenAI Agents tool that is passed to the `Agent`.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import timedelta
from temporalio import activity, workflow
from temporalio.contrib.openai_agents.temporal_tools import activity_as_tool

with workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():
    from agents import Agent, Runner

@dataclass
class Weather:
    city: str
    temperature_range: str
    conditions: str

@activity.defn
async def get_weather(city: str) -> Weather:
    """Get the weather for a given city."""
    return Weather(city=city, temperature_range="14-20C", conditions="Sunny with wind.")

@workflow.defn
class WeatherAgent:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, question: str) -> str:
        agent = Agent(
            name="Weather Assistant",
            instructions="You are a helpful weather agent.",
            tools=[
                activity_as_tool(
                    get_weather, 
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10)
                )
            ],
        )
        result = await Runner.run(starting_agent=agent, input=question)
        return result.final_output
```


### Agent Handoffs

The OpenAI Agents SDK supports agent handoffs, where one agent can transfer control to another agent.
In this example, one Temporal workflow wraps the entire multi-agent system:

```python
@workflow.defn
class CustomerServiceWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_agent = self.init_agents()

    def init_agents(self):
        faq_agent = Agent(
            name="FAQ Agent",
            instructions="Answer frequently asked questions",
        )
        
        booking_agent = Agent(
            name="Booking Agent", 
            instructions="Help with booking and seat changes",
        )
        
        triage_agent = Agent(
            name="Triage Agent",
            instructions="Route customers to the right agent",
            handoffs=[faq_agent, booking_agent],
        )
        
        return triage_agent

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, customer_message: str) -> str:
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=self.current_agent,
            input=customer_message,
            context=self.context,
        )
        return result.final_output
```
