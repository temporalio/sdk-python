    .. warning::
        This class is experimental and may change in future versions.
        Use with caution in production environments.

    This plugin integrates OpenTelemetry tracing with the Temporal SDK, providing
    automatic span creation for workflows, activities, and other Temporal operations.
    It uses the new OpenTelemetryInterceptor implementation.

    Unlike the prior TracingInterceptor, this allows for accurate duration spans and parenting inside a workflow
    with temporalio.contrib.opentelemetry.workflow.tracer()

    Your tracer provider should be created with `create_tracer_provider` for it to be used within a Temporal worker.
