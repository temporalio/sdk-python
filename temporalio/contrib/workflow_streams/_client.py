"""External-side client for Workflow Streams.

Used by activities, starters, and any code with a workflow handle to
publish messages and subscribe to topics on a workflow that hosts a
:class:`WorkflowStream`.

Each published value is turned into a :class:`Payload` via the client's
sync payload converter. The **codec chain** (e.g. encryption, compression)
is **not** run per item — it runs once at the envelope
level when Temporal's SDK encodes the ``__temporal_workflow_stream_publish``
signal args and the ``__temporal_workflow_stream_poll`` update result.
Running the codec per item as well would double-encrypt / double-compress,
because the envelope path covers the items again. The per-item
``Payload`` still carries the encoding metadata (``encoding: json/plain``,
``messageType``, etc.) required by ``subscribe(result_type=T)`` on the
consumer side.

        Automatically follows continue-as-new chains when the client
        was created via :py:meth:`create`.

        Args:
            topics: Topic filter. A single topic name, a list of topic
                names, or None. None or empty list means all topics.
            from_offset: Global offset to start reading from.
            result_type: Optional target type. Each yielded
                :class:`WorkflowStreamItem` has its ``data`` decoded via
                the client's sync payload converter. When omitted, the
                converter's default ``Any`` decoding is used (for the
                stock JSON converter that means a Python primitive,
                ``dict``, or ``list``). Pass
                ``result_type=temporalio.common.RawValue`` for an
                opaque ``RawValue`` wrapping the original
                ``Payload`` — useful for heterogeneous topics where
                the caller dispatches on ``Payload.metadata`` or wants
                to forward the bytes without decoding.
            poll_cooldown: Minimum interval between polls to avoid
                overwhelming the workflow when items arrive faster
                than the poll round-trip. Defaults to 100ms.

        Yields:
            :class:`WorkflowStreamItem` for each matching item.
