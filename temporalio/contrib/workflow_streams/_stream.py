"""Workflow-side stream object for Workflow Streams.

Instantiate :class:`WorkflowStream` once from your workflow's ``@workflow.init``
method. The constructor registers the stream signal, update, and query
handlers on the current workflow via
:func:`temporalio.workflow.set_signal_handler`,
:func:`temporalio.workflow.set_update_handler`, and
:func:`temporalio.workflow.set_query_handler`.

For workflows that support continue-as-new, include a
``WorkflowStreamState | None`` field on the workflow input and pass it as
``prior_state`` — it is ``None`` on fresh starts and carries accumulated
state on continue-as-new.

Workflow-side and client-side topic handles
(:meth:`WorkflowTopicHandle.publish` and
:meth:`TopicHandle.publish`) both use the synchronous payload
converter for per-item ``Payload`` construction. The codec chain
(e.g. encryption, compression) is **not** run per item on either
side — it runs once at the envelope level when Temporal's SDK
encodes the signal/update that carries the batch. Running it per
item as well would double-encrypt, because every signal arg
already goes through the client's ``DataConverter.encode`` at
dispatch time.
