"""Shared data types for the Workflow Streams contrib module.

The user-facing ``data`` fields on :class:`WorkflowStreamItem` are
:class:`temporalio.api.common.v1.Payload`. Per-item values are converted to
``Payload`` by the payload converter at publish time, and the resulting
bytes/metadata are preserved per item so subscribers can decode with
``subscribe(result_type=T)``. The codec chain (e.g. encryption, compression)
applies once at the outer signal/update envelope level — not separately to each
embedded item — so codec behavior is symmetric between workflow-side and
client-side publishing.

The wire representation (``PublishEntry``, ``_WorkflowStreamWireItem``) uses
base64-encoded ``Payload.SerializeToString()`` bytes because the default JSON
payload converter cannot serialize a ``Payload`` embedded inside a dataclass
(it only special-cases top-level Payloads on signal/update args).
